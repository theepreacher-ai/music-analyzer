2. **Does NOT download** YouTube videos

### YouTube Terms of Service

2. **Creative Commons YouTube Content**
   - Some YouTube videos are licensed under Creative Commons
   - Check video description for license information
   - Even then, direct download may violate ToS

3. **Downloaded Content With Permission**
   - If you have legal permission to download content
   - Upload the file directly rather than using YouTube URL

### Why YouTube Integration is Limited

Due to browser security policies:
- Cross-origin restrictions prevent direct audio capture from YouTube iframes
- This is intentional to protect content creators
- The app respects these browser security measures

### Alternative Approach

3. Upload the file directly to this analyzer
